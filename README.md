### Overview

These scripts represent some of the work I’m most proud of. They provide a streamlined framework for analyzing single-cell datasets, offering an immediate overview of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across clusters when comparing tissues or conditions. The same logic enables flexible and intuitive clonotype-tracking visualizations, with options to highlight specific TCR sequences on demand.

### Why These Scripts Matter

Anyone who has worked in bioinformatics knows the familiar rhythm: biologists constantly need new figure aesthetics, updated comparisons, or custom subsetting—often at the last minute. These scripts were built as a “one-stop shop” to quickly generate high-quality summary plots so collaborators can immediately see the biological story. Once these initial visualizations guide the narrative, more targeted and publication-ready figures can be created based on the insights revealed.

### Within each script
1. dotplot_deg - this helps you create a dotplot for the top 25 degs for each comparison for each defined cluster. So it can help you compare the DEGs between tissue1 vs tissue2 within cluster Cd4 for example

### What You Can Do With This Toolkit
	•	Rapid DEG exploration for each cluster between tissue/condition groups
	•	Seamless clonotype tracking across clusters, samples, or phenotypic states
	•	Select and visualize specific TCR sequences as needed
	•	Produce clean, customizable figures that can be adapted for manuscripts
